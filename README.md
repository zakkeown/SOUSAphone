# SOUSA Training Pipeline

Training infrastructure for drum rudiment classification using PyTorch Lightning, Hydra, and Transformers.

## Overview

This project trains 4 SOTA audio models (AST, HTS-AT, BEATs, EfficientAT) on 40-class drum rudiment classification using the SOUSA dataset.

## Tech Stack

- PyTorch Lightning for training
- Hydra for configuration
- HuggingFace Transformers for models
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- PEFT for parameter-efficient fine-tuning

## Status

Under development - Phase 1: Foundation
